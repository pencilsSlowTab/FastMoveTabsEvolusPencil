          TOOL to quickly move tabs in evolus Pencils.
====================================================================================

### Execute the tool
1. You should have Java installed (at least Java 6)
2. Download Zip, unzip it.
3. Go to the build folder.
4. On Windows, double click on run.bat. On linux, execute run.sh.


### How does it work

You load the pencils file (*.ep), all the tabs are displayed, you press up and down button to move the tabs at the position you want.  When you move a tab, it is saved automatically.
You will need to reload the file if it was opened in Evolus Pencil.




Written in Java.


PS: the tool is a workaround, I hope someone will fix Pencils directly soon, so this tool will become useless!
