          TOOL to quickly move tabs in evolus Pencils.
====================================================================================

### Execute the tool
1. You should have Java installed (at least Java 6)
2. Download the fastMoveTab.jar in build folder.
3. On Windows, download in the same folder run.bat and launch it. On linux, download in the same folder run.sh and launch it.


### How does it work

You load the pencils file (*.ep), all the tabs are displayed, you press up and down button to move the tabs at the position you want.  When you move a tab, it is saved automatically.
You will need to reload the file if it was opened in Evolus Pencil.




Written in Java.


PS: the tool is a workaround, I hope someone will fix Pencils directly soon, so this tool will become useless!
