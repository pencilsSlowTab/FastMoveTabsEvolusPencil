====================================================================================
          TOOL to quickly move tabs in evolus Pencils.
====================================================================================

### Execute the tool
Run with at least Java 6

Download the fastMoveTab.jar in build folder.

Launch the command to execute:
	java -jar fastMoveTab.jar



### How does it work

You load the pencils file (*.ep), all the tabs are displayed, you press up and down button to move the tabs at the position you want.  When you move a tab, it is saved automatically.





Written in Java.


PS: the tool is a workaround, I hope someone will fix Pencils directly soon, so this tool will become useless!
